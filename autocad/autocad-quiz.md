#### Q1. You have an application using a 100 GB MySQL database that you are migrating into AWS. What should you consider when deciding between whether to host the database on RDS for MySQL or Aurora?

- [ ] cost
- [ ] ease of maintenance vs. granularity of control
- [x] all of these answers
- [ ] the current storage engine used by the application, such as InnoDB or MyISAM

#### Q2. The LAYOFF command turns off the layer of any selected object. What happens if you select an object on the current drafting layer?

- [ ] AutoCAD turns off the current drafting layer and sets up a new layer in the Layer Properties Manager.
- [ ] AutoCAD turns off the current drafting layer and sets the current drafting layer to Layer 0 (zero).
- [x] AutoCAD prompts you if you want to turn off that layer.
- [ ] AutoCAD turns off the current drafting layer with no prompt.

#### Q3. Sometimes you will need to match properties of one object to another using the Match Properties (MATCHPROP) command. When matching the properties of an existing viewport to a new one, which setting do you turn off in Match Properties to ensure that the viewport scale is not matched across to the new viewport?

- [ ] Special Properties/Viewport
- [ ] Basic Properties/Layer
- [ ] Special Properties/Center object
- [x] Basic Properties/Linetype Scale

#### Q4. When using the Multiple Points (POINT) command, which specific AutoCAD setting should you change from the default setting?

- [ ] Change your layer (LAYER) so that points can be seen easily.
- [ ] Change your color (COLOR) so that points can be seen easily.
- [ ] Change your linetype (LINETYPE) so that points can be seen easily.
- [x] Change your point style (PTYPE) so that points can be seen easily.

#### Q5. When working in a layout, if a viewport is activated and locked and you accidentally zoom in or out, what happens to your viewport scale?

- [ ] Nothing. The viewport scale remains the same.
- [ ] The viewport scale returns to the default 1:1 scale.
- [ ] The viewport scale changes to the next available standard scale.
- [x] The viewport scale changes to a nonstandard scale.

#### Q6. Dynamic Input (DYNMODE) is switched on by default. Which function key do you use to control the Dynamic Input toggle?

- [ ] F8
- [ ] F1
- [ ] F9
- [x] F12 (Windows) or Shift+Command+D (Mac)

#### Q7. What specific annotation setting must be in place in order to place a text annotation in a drawing?

- [ ] a multileader style
- [ ] a dimension style
- [ ] a table style
- [x] a text style

#### Q8. In a standard AutoCAD installation, what does rolling the mouse backward do?

- [x] zoom out
- [ ] zoom left
- [ ] zoom in
- [ ] zoom right

#### Q9. When an inserted block is selected, a single grip is displayed on the block, as shown in the image below. What is this point known as when the block is created with the Create Block (BLOCK) command?

- [ ] origin point
- [ ] zero point
- [ ] block origin point
- [x] insertion point

#### Q10. External reference files (XREFs) link external drawings to the host drawing. You can set the XREF path type to no path, relative path, or full path. What value should be used for the relative path type?

- [ ] REFPATHTYPE = 2
- [ ] REFPATHTYPE = 3
- [x] REFPATHTYPE = 1
- [ ] REFPATHTYPE = 0

#### Q11. One of the benefits of a locked viewport in a layout is that you can activate it and work through the viewport on the objects and annotation in the model space, without worrying about affecting the viewport scale. What is the space in the activated viewport commonly known as when you do this?

- [ ] scaled model space
- [x] layout model space
- [ ] floating model space
- [ ] viewport model space

#### Q12. When working in a layout, if a viewport is activated and unlocked and you accidentally zoom in or out, what happens to your viewport scale?

- [ ] The viewport scale changes to the next available standard scale.
- [ ] Nothing. The viewport scale remains the same.Nothing. The viewport scale remains the same.
- [ ] The viewport scale returns to the default 1:1 scale.
- [x] The viewport scale changes to a nonstandard scale.

#### Q13. When using annotative scaling with dimensions and an annotative dimension style, which two variables need to match for the dimensioning to display in a scaled viewport?

- [ ] drawing scale and viewport scale
- [ ] insertion scale and viewport scale
- [ ] block scale and viewport scale
- [x] annotation scale and viewport scale

#### Q14. You can share tool palettes with other AutoCAD users, provided that the palette source drawing location does not change. What file do you need to share to ensure that another user is using the same tool palette?

- [ ] Shared Tool Palette (STP) file
- [ ] New Tool Palette (NTP) file
- [x] Exported Tool Palette (XTP) file
- [ ] User Tool Palette (UTP) file

#### Q15. A crossing selection selects what objects?

- [ ] only the objects completely outside the crossing selection
- [ ] only the objects not encompassed nor crossed by the crossing selection
- [ ] only the objects completely encompassed by the crossing selection
- [x] only the objects completely encompassed and crossed by the crossing selection
