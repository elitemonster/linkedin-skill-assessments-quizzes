- Larger z-index values appear on top of elements with a lower z-index value. Only positive numbers can be used. z-index must also be used with positioned elements.
- Smaller z-index values appear on top of elements with a larger z-index value. Negative and positive numbers can be used. z-index can be used with or without positioned elements.

#### Q14. What is the difference between the following line-height settings?
```css
line-height: 20px
line-height: 2
```
- The value of 20px will set the line-height to 20px. The value of 2 will set the line-height to twice the size of the corresponding font-size value.   <<<<---Correct
- The value of 20px will set the line-height to 20px. The value of 2 is not valid.
- The value of 20px will set the line-height to 20px. The value of 2 will default to a value of 2px.

#### Q15. In the following example, what color will paragraph one and paragraph two be?
