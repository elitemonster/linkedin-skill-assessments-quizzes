Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assessment
-----------------

#### Q1. What is an example of dynamic binding?
- any method 
- method overloading
- **method overriding** <<-- correct
- compiling

#### Q2. For which case would the use of a static attribute be appropriate?
- the number of people in each house in a small neighborhood
- the lot size for each house in a small neighborhood
- the color of each house in a small neighborhood
- **the weather conditions for each house in a small neighborhood** <<-- correct

#### Q3. Why would you create an abstract class, if it can have no real instances?
- **to avoid redundant coding in children** << -- correct
- to explore a hypothetical class
- to prevent unwanted method implementation
- to reserve memory for an unspecified class type

#### Q4. When does static binding happen?
- only when you export
- both at compile time and runtime
- **at compile time** <<-- correct
- at runtime

#### Q5. What is the best reason to use a design pattern?
- **It will result in code that is more extensible and maintainable.** <<-- correct
- It will result in a more compact product.
- It will speed initial development.
- It will allow you to add that design pattern to your resume.

#### Q6. What is encapsulation?
- defining classes by focusing on what is important for a purpose 
- **hiding the data and implementation details within a class** <<-- correct
- making all methods private
- using words to define classes

#### Q7. What is an IS-A relationship?
- It implies encapsulation.
- A superclass object has an IS-A relationship with its subclass.
- It implies a virtual method.
- **A subclass object has an IS-A relationship with its superclass or interface** <<-- correct

#### Q8. You want a method with behavior similar to a virtual method--it is meant to be overridden --expect that it does not have a mthod body. It just has a method signature. What kind of method should you use?
- an abstract method
- **a public internal method** <<-- correct
- an internal method 
- a protected internal method

#### Q9. Which code creates a new object from the Employee class?
- Employee current Employee = Employee.Create();
- **Employee current Employee = new Employee();** <<-- correct
- Employee currentEmployee;
- Employee currentEmployee = Employee.New();

#### Q10. Which type of constructor cannot have a return type?
- default
- copy
- parameterized
- **Constructors do not have a return type** <<-- correct

#### Q11. When is a constructor executed?
- **when an object is created from a class using the new keyword** <<-- correct
- when an class is defined using the class keyword
- every time an object is referenced
- when an object is created from a class using the create keyword

#### Q12. If a local class is defined in a function, what is true for an object of that class?
- **The object can be accessed, declared, and used locally in that function.** <<-- correct
- The object must be declared inside any other function.
- The object is temporarily accessible outside the function.
- The object can call all the other class members anywhere in the program.

#### Q13. Which two blocks are used to handle and check errors?
- do and check
- catching and trying 
- **try and catch** <<-- correct
- do and while

#### Q14. Why would you implement composition using an id instead of a reference?
- It makes it easier to save the entity.
- **all of these answers** <<-- correct
- It can make the entity retrieval more efficient
- It minimizes coupling.

#### Q15. Which statement best describes the method of inheritance in OOP?
- **Inheritance describes the ability to create new classes based on an existing class.** <<-- correct
- Inheritance means that a group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object.
- Inheritance forces a class to have a single repsonsibilitly from only one parent.
- Inheritance means that you will never have multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.
